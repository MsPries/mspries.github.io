			We found our training data on the NHL website, where it is publicly available. We used halftime commentary from each season 2004-2017. The halftime commentary from several games was cut short either due to breaking news or technical error, so these commentaries were omitted. Our training set consists of 5,600 commentaries.

		<div class="section-detail">
			We cleaned our data by removing advertisements and words unrecognized by the NLTK dictionary, except for proper nouns. We replaced proper nouns with PLAYER for any player name and team names with TEAM1, TEAM2, or TEAM_OTHER to align the teams being described with the teams competing or a team being described that is not currently competing.
			<br>
			We detected technical glitches by setting a minimum commentary of 500 words. We omitted any commentary that did not contain 500 words.

			We want to extend gratitude to Diana Cabrera from the NHL for clarifying the structure of the commentaries on their website as well as Tanisha Mitchell for helping us decide how to automate the data testing process.
